 The data was collected using an accelerometer and gyroscope, capturing 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity,    respectively.
    - Raw signal recorded from the Accelerometer are labeled tAcc-XYZ.
      - The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ, respectively).
    - Raw signals recorded from the gyroscope are labeled tGyro-XYZ.
    - The beginning of each variable is denoted by either a "t" or an "f"
      - The "t" denotes time domain signals, captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz
      - The "f" denotes frequency domain signals
      
    - Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAcJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
    - The magnitude of these 3-D signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm:
      - tBodyAccMag
      - tGravityAccMag
      - tBodyAccJerkMag
      - tBodyGyroMag,
      - tBodyGyroJerkMag
      
    - Finally, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of the signals, resulting in the following variables:
      - fBodyAcc-XYZ
      - fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
      - fBodyGyro-XYZ
      - fBodyAccJerkMag
      - fBodyGryoMag
      - fbodyGyroJerkMag
      
    - The mean and standard deviation (std) of each signal were estimated and included in the final dataset for each of the following signals:
      tBodyAcc-XYZ
      tGravityAcc-XYZ
      tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
      tBodyGyro-XYZ
      tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
      tBodyAccMag
      tGravityAccMag
      tBodyAccJerkMag
      tBodyGyroMag
      tBodyGyroJerkMag
      fBodyAcc-XYZ
      fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
      fBodyGyro-XYZ
      fBodyAccMag
      fBodyAccJerkMag
      fBodyGyroMag
      fBodyGyroJerkMag
