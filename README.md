##### Project Description: #####

The experiments for this dataset were performed by 30 volunteer subjects (19-48 years of age), each of whom wore a smartphone on their waists while performation a various activities, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying. Embedded in the smartphone was an accelerometer and a gyroscope to obtain 3-axial measurements of linear acceleration and angular velocity. 70% of the volunteers were randomly selected to generate the training data, while the other 30% were used to generate the test data. 

This repository is a collection of files for my final project in the Getting and Cleaning Data Course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization. Included in this collection are:
  1. This README file, containing basic information about the project and the data source
  2. A CodeBook, containing basic information about the variables and measurements included in the data
  3. The R file, run_analysis.R, which contains my R code for creating a final tidy dataset
