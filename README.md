##### Project Description: #####

The experiments for this dataset were performed by 30 volunteer subjects (19-48 years of age), each of whom wore a smartphone on their waists while performing various activities, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying. Embedded in the smartphone was an accelerometer and a gyroscope to obtain 3-axial measurements of linear acceleration and angular velocity. 70% of the volunteers were randomly selected to generate the training data, while the other 30% were used to generate the test data. 

The goal of this final project was to:
  1. Merge the provided training and test datasets to create one big data set
  2. Extract only the mean and standard deviation values for each measurement
  3. Rename the activities in the data set with descriptive names
  4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
  5. Create a second, independent tidy dataset from the dataset in Step 4 the includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

This repository is a collection of files for my final project in the Getting and Cleaning Data Course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization. Included in this collection are:
  1. This README file, containing basic information about the project and the data source
  2. A CodeBook, containing basic information about the variables and measurements included in the data
  3. The R file, run_analysis.R, which contains my commented R code for creating a final tidy dataset
